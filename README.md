# X-ray Pneumonia Classification using TPUs ðŸš€

This project focuses on building an X-ray image classification model to detect the presence of pneumonia in chest X-ray scans. The model is trained using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for accelerated deep learning computations.

## Key Features:

âœ… Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning.
âœ… Implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
âœ… Uses TPUs for high-performance model training.
âœ… Analyzes and visualizes model performance with Matplotlib and Pandas.
âœ… Evaluates accuracy, precision, and recall to mitigate overfitting.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset:

The dataset is split into training and validation sets to optimize the modelâ€™s learning. The classification model aims to differentiate between normal and pneumonia-infected X-ray scans.
